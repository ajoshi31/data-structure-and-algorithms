/*
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
Expected time complexity is O(n)

Examples:

1) Input:  txt[] = "BACDGABCDA"  pat[] = "ABCD"
   Output:   Found at Index 0
             Found at Index 5
             Found at Index 6
2) Input: txt[] =  "AAABABAA" pat[] = "AABA"
   Output:   Found at Index 0
             Found at Index 1
             Found at Index 4
